Chopra: Kings lacked intent at the start and kept losing wickets

With India experiencing a significant second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Kolkata Knight Riders captain Eoin Morgan was posed a question at the post-match press conference about whether he thinks the IPL should go on. He responded: ""When we came out of our first lockdown period, I remember the first sport was probably in New Zealand and then in Australia, the rugby union and the rugby league. Then slowly the Bundesliga started and the premier league started and that almost displayed you can play a sport when the country is almost in full lockdown.

Kolkata Knight Riders were found to be short on the minimum required over rate in the game against Mumbai Indians, the IPL said in a statement after the game. It was their second over-rate offence of the season, and so, as per the tournament rules, captain Eoin Morgan was fined INR 24 lakh (USD 32,000 approx.) and the rest of the playing XI either INR 6 (USD 8000 approx.) lakh or 25% of their match fee, whichever was lesser.
