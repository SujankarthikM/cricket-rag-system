Today it was the knuckle ball, so I stuck with it and bowled a lot of them. Sometimes it works, sometimes I get hit into the crowd and look like a bit of an idiot.\"On the advantage of bowling second:\"As a bowler [we] look what the opposition has done, what bowlers have worked for them. [Today] we summed it up to this: it was skidding on a bit, so a good hard length when the ball was new was sort of not bouncing. So you could pull it back a little bit, and [use] the slower balls to hit hard on that wicket to give the batsman no freedom to hit in the arc.\"\n\nDeivarayan Muthu is a sub-editor at ESPNcricinfo\n\nOver 20•SRH 178/4\n\n'Sehwag saved IPL by picking me' - Gayle\n\nGayle, with all the big T20 batting records to his name, has nothing more to prove, but wants people to \"just put some respect on the name\"\n\nChris Gayle: T20's biggest visionary and revolutionary\n\nThe man from Jamaica, who first turned chaotic T20 hitting into a science, continues to mould his batting to suit the circumstances - to brutal effect, as always\n\nTalking Points: Ashwin's calculated punts pay off\n\nCould batting first become the next big trend?

    "content": "KKR won by 3 wickets (with 1 ball remaining)\n\nFrom needing 13 in 25 balls, KKR lost 6 for 7 in 3.5 overs to almost lose an un-loseable match\n\nManjrekar: Capitals didn't look like a champion team when it mattered\n\nSign up for ESPN+and catch all the action from the IPL live in the US. Match highlights of Qualifier 2 between Delhi Capitals and Kolkata Knight Riders are available herein English, and hereDelhi Capitals' brief flutter at the topSent in to bat, Capitals began sedately but overs three and four together brought 26 runs. Prithvi Shaw had begun aggressively while Shikhar Dhawan hit a couple of sixes off Sunil Narine after having spent his first seven balls score-less. Both openers flowing and the score at a healthy 32 for no loss in four overs meant Capitals looked strong, but that was as good as it got for them while batting.Varun struck with his first ball, Shaw not reading the one coming into him to be trapped in front. That began Knight Riders' familiar spin strangulation. Dhawan looked like he would aim to bat through the innings, but fell to Varun before the pacers would come on at the death. The returning Marcus Stoinis added balance to the Capitals side on paper, but batting him at three after so much time out in the cold didn't come off. When Rishabh Pant too fell cheaply, Capitals were 90 for 4 in 15.2 overs, struggling to get above a run a ball.Venkatesh Iyer scored his third half-century of the season•BCCIThe no-ball and Shreyas Iyer's grandstand finishShreyas had come in to bat in the 12th over, which is later than he generally comes out for Capitals. For most of his innings, he just rotated the strike. His fifth-wicket partner Shimron Hetmyer was more adventurous, though he had a slice of luck when on 2 in the 17th over. A shovel was brilliantly caught by Shubman Gill diving forward at long-on, but Varun had over-stepped - by a thin margin. Hetmyer whacked two sixes against Lockie Ferguson's pace in the next over, though he gave it away when going for a non-existent run to be caught short of the crease by a long margin.Shreyas then provided a rousing end to the innings, hitting a four and a final-ball six off Shivam Mavi as he conceded 15 in the final over, and the Capitals' total was in competitive territory given how the pitch was playing. Mavi, who had 1 for 12 in three overs till then, had his figures spoilt somewhat.Venkatesh Iyer takes offVenkatesh encapsulated the Knight Riders' opening stand with one shot. In the fifth over, he sauntered down the track and clubbed the ball effortlessly over long-on, and he did it against Kagiso Rabada. He had earlier deposited Axar Patel over deep midwicket too, and that nonchalant six off Rabada reinforced how dominantly Knight Riders had started. The powerplay brought 51 runs with the openers still going strong, Shubman Gill playing the supporting role to Venkatesh's swashbuckling strokeplay.The end of the powerplay didn't slow the scoring down. Dew had set in with force just before Capitals' innings ended, and they got the worse end of the conditions. But even if the dew made the ball more difficult to grip and come on to the bat more easily, it still needed the batsmen to execute their shots against bowlers of high pedigree, and they did that with panache.Venkatesh reached his half-century in 38 balls, eventually falling to Rabada when he pulled straight to deep square leg. That broke the opening stand, but by then Knight Riders already had 96 runs on the board and only 12.2 overs had been bowled.R Ashwin goes on a celebratory run after dismissing Shakib Al Hasan•BCCIThe scramble at the deathThere was no hint of the drama that would unfold when Nitish Rana pulled Anrich Nortje to deep square leg at the end of the 16th over. But it began a procession that didn't look like it would end. Gill, who had essayed a breath-taking front-foot pull off Nortje over long-on, was caught behind off an uncharacteristic poke after a controlled innings and Knight Riders suddenly found there weren't that many wickets to spare.The final over began with seven runs needed, and Knight Riders scored just one run off the first four balls while also losing Shakib Al Hasan and Narine. It was left to Tripathi to provide the final punch.Capitals, who had looked the best team on show in the league stage while deservedly topping it, ended their campaign with three straight losses.\n\nSaurabh Somani is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo\n\nOver 20•KKR 136/7\n\nWho are the youngest and oldest men to score a triple-century in Tests?\n\nAnd how many teams have won a T20 despite four or more of their batters bagging ducks?\n\nDavid Hussey: Brendon McCullum has 'given everybody a fresh lease of life'\n\nThe team mentor praised the head coach's impact in creating an environment where \"everybody's happy, everybody's smiling\"\n\nVenkatesh Iyer, the 'Stephen Fleming clone' who turned KKR's season around\n\nWhen IPL 2021 kicked off in India, Iyer didn't get a single game.
