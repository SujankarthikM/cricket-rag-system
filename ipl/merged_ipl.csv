With India experiencing a significant second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Kolkata Knight Riders captain Eoin Morgan was posed a question at the post-match press conference about whether he thinks the IPL should go on. He responded: ""When we came out of our first lockdown period, I remember the first sport was probably in New Zealand and then in Australia, the rugby union and the rugby league. Then slowly the Bundesliga started and the premier league started and that almost displayed you can play a sport when the country is almost in full lockdown.
