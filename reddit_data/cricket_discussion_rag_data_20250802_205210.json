      "content": "Ben Stokes: Unlike India, I’d have taken a draw over scoring a hundred Ben Stokes said he would have accepted a draw from the opposition rather than pursue personal milestones, as India did in a farcical end to the fourth Test. England offered to shake hands with 15 overs remaining on the final day at Old Trafford after Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, on 89 and 80 respectively, had saved India from defeat. The batsmen refused and faced five overs from Harry Brook and Joe Root, waiting for Jadeja to bring up his fifth Test hundred and Washington his first. Stokes did not want to risk any frontline bowlers with the fifth Test starting on Thursday at the Oval, and so turned to Brook, the only genuine unused option, who dropped as low as 35mph in serving up free hits for Jadeja. The England fielders barely acknowledged the landmarks, which Jadeja and Washington celebrated heartily, and suggested they would lack meaning. “As soon as it got to that point where the draw’s inevitable, I was never going to risk any of my frontline bowlers with the short turnaround that we have and the workload that we’ve got through this week and throughout the series as well,” Stokes said with his side still leading the series 2-1. “As soon as the 15 overs or last hour was there, it was always going to be a shake hands. “The only other person who’s actually got any bowling workload into them is Harry Brook. But I did have to tell him, ‘Please don’t do anything stupid. We can’t have you pulling a side or doing anything different.’ Naturally, you’re going to be fatigued, even if you don’t bowl. So, I was just like, ‘Get through this period.’ ” Stokes praised Jadeja and Washington’s innings, combining for a partnership of 203 in 55.2 overs to save the game, and Gautam Gambhir, the India head coach, suggested England would have done the same. “If someone is batting on 90 and the other one is batting on 85, don’t they deserve a hundred?” Gambhir said. “Would they have walked off if someone from England’s side would have been batting on 90 or 85, if someone had the opportunity to claim his first Test hundred? Wouldn’t you allow him to do it?” However, Stokes said the batsmen did not need three figures to make their efforts meaningful. “The situation that India found themselves in there with us opening the game open slightly, that partnership was massive,” the England captain said. “You hold your hands up. They played incredibly, incredibly well. I don’t think there would have been too much more satisfaction from walking off 100 not out, getting your team out of a tricky situation, than walking off at 80 or 90 not out. That’s what you’ve done for your team. “Ten more runs, or whatever it was, isn’t going to change the fact that you managed to get your team out of a very, very tricky situation and almost saved your team from a series defeat before the last game.”",

Hi Yesterday, ICC announced BYJU'S as global partner until 2023 Are you guys ok with BYJUs written all over, especially on the Indian Cricket team's T-Shirt? I am not. BYJUs recently bought a startup called WhiteHatJr for $300M. This startup was really suspicious. Their false advertisements, sales pitch, curriculum. Everything seemed to have issues in it. In Sept 2020, When I looked deeper I found many issues. I decided to write about it on Quora and Reddit. Soon my accounts were suspended. So I moved to YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn and soon those accounts were also taken down. In total 17 videos, 2 YT channels, 2 Twitter handles permanently suspended, 3 articles from LinkedIn, the LinkedIn account itself was suspended twice, and these are just my accounts. 100s of other's accounts were taken down by BYJUs and WhiteHatJr ORM team. WhiteHatJr and Byjus tried their best to take down all my content from the internet and when I kept on making new accounts, they filed a $2.75M defamation lawsuit over me. Please google search \"Pradeep Poonia WhiteHat Jr\" to know more about the case, you will find a lot of news articles, videos, and posts regarding the same. The case is still in Delhi High Court, the next hearing is on 9th April. They have a lot of money and a bunch of lawyers to drag this case for years while I become penniless. For eg in the first hearing, they got India's ex-Attorney General of India, Mukul Rohtagi to represent them. BYJUs is notorious for taking down dissent from the Internet, manipulating Quora and google play reviews, inhumane work culture in their offices, pushing poor parents into loan traps, creating issues for parents in refunds, the list goes on and on. Earlier Sahara India used to sponsor BCCI, which turned out to be a big fraud. Then I think KingFisher was also for some time sponsoring some cricket teams in IPL. And now this BYJUs. Now I know this post is not directly related to cricket, but in a way it is. When we watch cricket we generate value. Our viewership is valuable. We help brands make money. Shouldn't we have a little say in who gets to sponsor ICC or BCCI? It would be much more fun to watch cricket if even the brands printed on cricketers T-shirts are some good ethical brands we trust and like, it would be more fun to support teams that way. Why is the that it's mostly a scam which gets to get printed on T-shirts? PS: I did a very polite comment under Anurag Dahiya's (Chief Commercial Officer of international cricket council) LinkedIn post saying we don't like seeing Byjus everywhere while watching cricket. And guess what, just like Byjus, he also deleted my comment. EDIT: I have started a change. org petiton. Link in the comments. Please do sign it, together we can really make a difference. Thank you.

I'm a comedian and I was commentating on the ACC (alternative commentary collective) at the time. We made jokes about some weird texts we got on the text line of cricket horndogs. Thought it would be funny to post something to prompt some more erotic fanfiction on the show (very on theme for the commentary). It ended up being far more intense and hilarious than I expected so popped it up on soc med, thought it was funnier to imply it was out of the blue (honestly quite drunk and sleep deprived), hence why I blacked out the name, honestly didnt even think about the culture of the cricket subreddit or bringing the community into disrepute. Genuinely was just a laugh. But I'd like to genuinely apologize. I didnt think it through properly and it's not something I'd do again.\n\n&gt;Tldr: I'm sorry!! I think its just in the nature to stretch the truth online for comedic effect but I obviously went too far here.

I wish it could be possible for the mods to charge her with defamation of character, maybe that would prevent people from making statements without thinking of the consequences...",

I’m a decent club batsman, I’ve made an A-Grade century and comfortably average in the high 20s against good opposition. A few years ago I played at a club tournament in country Victoria and the opening bowler on the other side was a premier firsts player from South Australia. Not a professional player, but a star at the level below who had never quite made it into the state team. He had been clocked bowling at 145 before. I faced about 2 overs from him and didn’t score a run. If the ball was on the stumps I guessed where it was going and managed to block with basically no footwork (beaten for pace). If it wasn’t at the stumps I just played and missed. He was probably only bowling in the mid 130s but I just could not see the ball. That was the most outclassed I’ve ever felt on a cricket field. And then after I was dismissed for a painful 3 (by the medium pacer at the other end) I remembered that there are batsman who would be good enough to hit that terrifying bowler for 15-20 runs an over. Basically, professional cricketers are absolutely amazing and criticising them for being ‘shit’ is nonsensical.",

Anyway, whenever we went to the nets, even years after he’d stopped playing regularly, I could not see the ball. He was still high on weed, running on a can of V and a sausage roll while smoking every day, and I was praying that every ball was missing the stumps so so I could pretend to be leaving it. Even now he’s playing club cricket in Auckland and roughing people up. In junior cricket I played a few games against Michael Neser and he was hard enough to face at 13 — my second-best innings was opening the batting against his team and scoring 22 not out before retiring, which was the first time Neser didn’t get me out within a few balls. He was playing up an age group too. I went to the same high school as Cameron Boyce for a year and I was opening the bowling for the school B team, he opened the batting for the A team. Between him and the other opening bat who was already playing first grade — he might have played for Queensland if his wrist would hold together — smashed me for 26 runs in the first over. I bowled the cheapest over until they retired. When I batted, Cam bounced me out bowling medium pace.

Back then, our team was coached by a former Indian spinner, and one of Ranji's all time highest wicket takers (V.V. Kumar). He was 70 years old then, and would still have a bowl in the nets often. Trust me, none of our batsmen could ever play him successfully! With every ball, he'd draw you forward ever so slightly, and by the time you faced the third ball or so, you'd be out stumped, trying to defend. Can't imagine the level of skill it would've taken for international cricketers to face the likes of him, Venkataraghavan, Bedi, Prasanna, etc, and score runs off them!",

Not to mention, couldn't watch the game with them to explain it because they are at 10:30am on weekdays. I don't understand how the ICC could screw this up so badly. They were literally handed the dream opportunity to grow the game, but instead throw it all way to pander to the BCCI and Indian market.
