The ball of the century I still watch with as much amazement as I did when it was live. The biggest possible stage, the biggest possible personality, and the biggest possible result. As far as single deliveries go, that one will never be beaten. Cricket is better for having had Shane Warne involved, and despite all the hate his commentary gets, is poorer for his loss. His actual analysis and cricket brain were first rate.",

      "content": "Oh my in absolute shock. I'm going to tell my one Shane Warne story which I think sums him up. 2006 - as a young kid, I went to Hampshire to watch the county championship game against Lancashire on the last game of the season. It turned into a bit of a farce as the Lancashire players wanted to watch the Ryder cup so they sent out two players who didn't like golf to just dead bat it for the draw. So the game turned bonkers, all 11 players bowled, Michael Carberry started bowling left handed and Warney started running in from the boundary and bowling balls as high in the air as he possibly could. At the end of the game, there were a few kids and a surprising number of journalists around who wanted to interview him as skipper about what had just gone on. Despite the furore, as calm as anything, he said to the journalists, wait 10 minutes, I'm gonna stay with the kids if that's ok and spent a good few minutes with each of the kids signing autographs, taking photos and giving everyone items from the changing room no longer needed as it was the end of the season. I've got a Dimi Mascarenhas glove and Shaun Udal shirt from that day and a photo with Warne that we got framed and is cherished. I've met a fair few cricketers but none were ever as kind as Shane Warne, it said a lot about the man. RIP",

Watched so many videos of him trying to figure out how to do that. Was slightly too young to remember the vast majority of his Test career (maybe for the best as an Englishman), but he was Hampshire captain and at Rajasthan Royals, two teams I followed as a boy. Not that this matters, anyone who loves cricket has suffered a loss. One of the greatest to ever do it. My annual 2005 Ashes highlights rewatch is gonna feel slightly different now.

Mum was told that it was \"some nice young bloke called Shane\" who had ran the clinic. Mum was a sports nut and instantly knew who it was. By the time she was told he was on his way out the school. Mum raced out and apologised for the other staff not recognising him. They started to chat.. and chat... and chat. They ended up back in the staff room for a couple of cuppas. They ended up speaking for a good couple of hours. Mum was very impressed by him and we became huge Warnie fans. I messaged him about 18 months ago and mentioned the events. For everything that he'd experienced in the years since he still remembered that day at our school and said it was fond memory of the teacher who he perfectly described. Rest in Peace, Shane.

As a 12 year old boy some 29 years ago when I met my hero I was struck by the time he took to shake us kids' hands on a school trip. He was as patient as we were obnoxious. And yes he was wearing a pork pie hat and happy pants; another reason I will never forget him. Shane Keith Warne was an everymans hero. A battler who came good from humble beginnings and no matter how much we lauded him he stayed relatable. He was too large for this life and like literally hundreds of millions of cricket fans around the world I am so sorry he is no longer with us. Rest in Peace Warnie",

Yes they're not 50s and 100s, but they're very important. Strike rate matters in T20 cricket. We all knew he was going to captain the World Cup. I was one of the criticisers of his selection. He shouldn't be picked. Players like Yashavi Jaiswal, Abhishek Sharma, Ruturaj Gaikwad and Shubman Gill are far more deserving. But he proved he was the right man for the job, both with the captaincy and the bat. One of the best batters to watch when on song. His six hitting ability is just next level. Who's going to captain now? His spot is vacant now, most likely going to be filled by Jaiswal. But with Kohli retiring as well, another opener can snatch the other spot too. A lot of things are changing in Indian cricket. We're not gonna see Rohit, Kohli and maybe the likes of Jadeja in 2026. Going to be very interesting",
