To score 13 centuries against those bowlers with no bowling restrictions, no helmet and no neutral umpires is incredible. Not for nothing is he considered one of the greatest ever.

The other players in the team also have to.\n\nThe Indian team now has a lot of new players and new captains. There is a difference between the Indian team then versus now. So everyone has to perform not just him. And I dont know why Fucking USA and Canada fans are here. You guys dont even have an proper team the team is full of indians.",

Taking 8 wickets in a match will be overshadowed by someone taking the rest 12 (10 fer), scoring 50 and sharing a big partnership will mean the batsman who most likely scored a 100 is recognized more. Lots of NZ all rounders have helped the team win matches but people often underrate them.",

Watch his highlights and you’ll see what I mean. Ball after ball — identical on the surface, but each one doing just enough to keep you guessing. He wasn’t flashy. No crazy swing, no wild bouncers. Just relentless accuracy that made even the greats look clueless. He played mind games with a cricket ball. And nine times out of ten, he won.",

They did what they did in the ODI World Cup in 2023 so fairplay. But even in the WTC final it was held in England giving them a massive advantage over India. Their test team is showing cracks including a home series draw to the inexperienced West Indies. They have also lost 4 consecutive series to India in test matches.

      "raw_body": "I have always wondered why the experts always say that the game has become easier now. No wonder that, a mistimed shot goes for a six and a mistimed forward defense turns out to be a straight drive. During that 70s era, only the batsmen with the perfect timing and technique would survive and score runs. That's why people like Barry Richards, Bradman and many other legends are incomparable with current players. A 300 is 70s and 300 in the 2010s have a lot of differences.",

For Karun Nair, the comeback moment has come and now it's on the verge of ending. How does one prepare for pressure when their entire life's dream is hanging on a knife's edge? Perhaps the only advantage he truly has is to know that it is infact, very probably, his last ever game getting to represent India, at the international level, his last opportunity to grab his lifelong dream and ambition. So now, it is in his hands to control his faith for one last time. So yes, the pressure Karun is facing right now is unparalleled. And I've never wanted a player to outperform and play a stand-out innings more than I hope for Karun to play one such knock now. [and to make it even more intense, he is batting when India is 5 wickets down at 120] And if at all things don't work out, Karun can still rejoice in what's been one of the most inspiring comeback call-back to squad stories and the infamous 303* in 2016 in Chennai, which will stay decorated and adorned in the history books for decades to come. P.S: wrote this mid-game when he came out to bat, so happy he got to a half century. Hope he keeps going on!",

Horrible to see Woakes injured and I hope he recovers. But he's had a bad series all round and this is time to move on. He's not a front line bowler and that's how he's been used far too often. Archer and Atkinson to open the bowling, Tongue, Carse or another bowler behind, Stokes (hopefully) as the 4th seamer, and I'd bring Rehan Ahmed in as the last (even if only for his batting).",

He is trying to hard to be react rather than be aggressive as a coach and his record shows. Same number of wins in tests 4 as he has loses in white ball. Maybe BCCI should split coaching duties like England did to great success rather than sticking with the same guy because coaches and captains coming out of IPL are not suited to tests, they are very defensive in nature due to ipl demanding that attribute and hence they're successfull in white ball but really poor In red ball.

At the same time he can be overblowing the yelling part. It is a ground after all and sometimes you need to talk loudly to let people know. Gambhir might be irked when told not to approach the pitch or square but cussing and \"you are just a curator\" is uncalled for. Curator hasn't given much details. But if the facts about the square and pitch is true, I think that is strange too. Other matches we have seen teams look very closely at the pitch. Overall just another day of fighting for Gambhir.",

I'm sure, along the lines of what you mentioned im the article, its probably sole old fashioned hog washboard being the gentleman's game somofmclurse we wear pants, but in reality its far more practical. Firstly, its a summer sport not a winter one. The biggest issue is the sun. Long loose fitting pants, especially white ones (given they reflect light) help prevent sunburn and are actually quite cool. You only have to look at the long robes that are worn in hot desert countries to realise that despite providing a full covering they keep the wearer cooler than if they were wearing shorts or some equivalent. There is science out there that says that even darker colours like black or brown which we would generally associate with absorbing more heat are cooler than some sort of shorts equivalent. I think what is important note is that cricket whites are designed to play cricket in where as dress pants or jeans are designed, in part, to keep the wearer warm. There is obviously other factors where pants are superior to shorts, sliding out in the field for example or so that your pads dont irritate the back of your legs. Simply put, clothing designed for a sport, is often quite comfortable and actually appropriate. Contrasting with other sports is also interesting. Baseball, not picked because there is a ball and bat, but because it is typcially a summer sport in the major markets, also uses long pants for similar protection reasons. First and obviously the sun but like cricket sliding on the ground is a common occurrence and it offers better protection to the player. On the flip side, footy which utilises shorts is a winter sport. You only need to look as recently as last weekend with the atrocious weather and massive amounts of rain on display to understand why. Having the minimum amount of material to get wet and heavy is a massive deal and is super important. Given cricketers come off for rain, being mobile while wet is less of an issue. In fact, even moisture from sweat is wicked away with specifically selected fabrics. In summary, while there may be some historical aspect behind wearing long pants with cricket, in the modern day long pants are an important part of the player's safety and comfort. When will cricketers wear shorts during games? Never.",

I also get that football / other team sports (none of which I've ever played) where people play in shorts are played on longer grass / watered grass. My question (asking to understand not to denigrate anyone) is this : If all of the above is true, how come people wear shorts during practice ? I assume an equal if not greater amount of sliding might be required and I also assume that people practice for longer - especially early in their careers, so more days in the sun. And if thigh guards and pads are better worn on pants (never worn these - so don't know from experience), how come teams don't practice in full length pants? They still wear these protective equipment during practice Also, does MCC rules have something to do with clothing just like Wimbledon's enforced dress code?",

Ishant &amp; Umesh were nowhere near the same quality of bowlers for the first 5-6 years of their career as they were in the latter half. Shami was good but used to be expensive. Only Bhuvi and Bumrah were good in test matches from the start. Prasidh has potential. Akash deep and siraj are doing alright. NKR has vastly improved his bowling. Hopefully Arsh can work on his fitness and be better in FC. A few more will come soon, fingers crossed. We used to rotate our bowlers when we had Bumrah, Shami, Bhuvi, Ishant and Umesh. Need to do that again. And play Kuldeep for duck's sake, so that we have more wicket taking options!",

This has led to people underrating our bowlers and also overrating our batters. People are just scared to call out how flat these wickets have been since South Africa came here in 2022 for obvious reasons. Although it's a flat wicket fairplay to Gill for silencing the unfair doubters. He came in at 0-2 in a tough situation after captaining in the field for 150+ overs knowing the outrage from the Indian fans. People calling him a flat track bully must be seasonal fans. Did they not see him clutch wins for India against us in 2024 in the 4th innings a couple of times???",
