He writes in his book Sunny Days about the cries of 'Kill him maan' from the spectators in the WI. To score 13 centuries against those bowlers with no bowling restrictions, no helmet and no neutral umpires is incredible. Not for nothing is he considered one of the greatest ever.

But the constant griping from England players is what’s annoying. “If you wanted 100, you should have batted like that earlier.” Stokes: “Do you want to score a hundred against Harry Brook?” When Jadeja replied, “It’s not in my hands,” Zak Crawley interfered, saying, “Then shake hands. It’s embarrassing.” These are just a few examples of things England players said. Let’s not forget the laughing after every ball or clapping to mock Indian players. But since it’s England doing it, it all conveniently falls under the “spirit of cricket.” Stokes said it wouldn't make a difference if it’s 90 or 100, as long as it helps the team win. But then why was Stokes celebrating his own hundred earlier that day? Why shouldn’t Washi go for his maiden hundred? If he thinks milestones are selfish, then the first thing he should do is break the Lord's Honours Board. Imagine if somehow Dawson was on a hat-trick and Jadeja offered Stokes to shake hands, saying that Indian bowlers can’t come out to bat because they’re tired. Would Stokes have accepted it?",

Taking 8 wickets in a match will be overshadowed by someone taking the rest 12 (10 fer), scoring 50 and sharing a big partnership will mean the batsman who most likely scored a 100 is recognized more.

Ashwin I will miss you so much. It is a sad day to see Ashwin Anna go down like this. He totally deserved a farewell home series. Absolute legend of the game.

Don't get me wrong on paper they were in the top 3 favourites for the tournament with England and the West Indies, but they didn't do great in the 2022 World Cup at home and the 2021 World Cup was just win the toss, chase and win. They did what they did in the ODI World Cup in 2023 so fairplay. But even in the WTC final it was held in England giving them a massive advantage over India. Their test team is showing cracks including a home series draw to the inexperienced West Indies. They have also lost 4 consecutive series to India in test matches. The last 2 times they toured us even with the GOAT Smith they could only draw the series 2-2 twice. Well done Afghanistan.",

You can't enforce social distancing with that big crowd. Plus I see people commenting about mask. Staying at home is the best option. I put my mask religiously when I go out but tell you the truth, it's extremely uncomfortable and I start feeling suffocation after an hour or so. So I wouldn't pass on judgement to people who sit in afternoon in that heat watching test match because I know even I would make a mistake and remove it. T20 is shorter so you see more people wearing it",

Is it our bowlers swinging it both ways and being unplayable for the first 5-6 overs? Is it Koach coming good when we needed him? Is it the team rallying around someone who was hellbent on making it home? I really can't say. It's a huge boiling pot of all of this with a dash of the festive spirit of Deepavali. This win is just something that we all needed. Everything came together, conspired to make this a game for the ages. I'm so happy I got to watch this live. Plus watching Sunny Gavaskar, who's normally measured with words and backlift jump like a kid at a fair, man it just puts this into perspective. This reminds me so much of a time that was like the 96 wc win over Pak. Sorry for rambling, I've probably had one drink too many. Happy Deepawali to each and every one of you!",

But going for the run out when you’re in your delivery stride and pulling out is, to me (and I know this is a controversial opinion) deceitful. You’ve tricked the batter by pretending to bowl. I just think that wording needs to be cleared up. With other dismissals, we can go frame-by-frame, to check the exact moment the stumps were broken vs. when a foot was lifted/bat grounded. That “normally expected” is too vague - just make it “before the ball has been delivered” and then there’s no debate 🤷‍♂️",

I'm a comedian and I was commentating on the ACC (alternative commentary collective) at the time. We made jokes about some weird texts we got on the text line of cricket horndogs. Thought it would be funny to post something to prompt some more erotic fanfiction on the show (very on theme for the commentary). It ended up being far more intense and hilarious than I expected so popped it up on soc med, thought it was funnier to imply it was out of the blue (honestly quite drunk and sleep deprived), hence why I blacked out the name, honestly didnt even think about the culture of the cricket subreddit or bringing the community into disrepute. Genuinely was just a laugh. But I'd like to genuinely apologize. I didnt think it through properly and it's not something I'd do again.\n\n&gt;Tldr: I'm sorry!! I think its just in the nature to stretch the truth online for comedic effect but I obviously went too far here. Big cricket fan, big fan of the subreddit, and hope you guys can forgive me.\n\nI think it is only fair that she should apologise and come clean on Twitter where she made the accusation and received thousands of RTs and likes by maligning the sub and the users here for her own personal gains.

But had Australia managed to scrape a win in the last leg of this epic series, everyone would now be praising their invincibility instead. The people in the team are the same, but their performance on that particular day/hour seems to change the entire course of their history.

Most importantly it came while chasing in a WC semi-final against the best bowling lineup of the tournament who are in top of their game at their home. He is the highest scorer in both the Ind-Nz matches this WC averaging 130+ with SR &gt; 100. You can say he has been the best batsman across both the Ind-Nz matches of this WC. Only player to score a century against India ( that too 2 ) this WC. It seemed he was the lone man fighting for Nz this match. Hope this underrated batsman is given the due credit",

It will give new teams a chance to play against top teams.",
