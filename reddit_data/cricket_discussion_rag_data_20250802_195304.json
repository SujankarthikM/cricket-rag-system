He’s not suited to the pitches (yes, they move more now but he’s still smaller and slower than the likes of Boland, who Aussies sometimes use to evidence the change of their pitches). Potts can do Woakes’ workhorse line and length role very well. An attack of Wood, Archer, Carse, Atkinson, Potts and maybe Overton isn’t great but it has potential.",

      "raw_body": "A bunch of pommies got upset that I blamed England's approach for their bowling fatigue and not actually the schedule which has remained the same for 20+ years.  Here's a bunch of data to back this up\n\nHere are the overs bowled by both teams so far this series\n\nTest 1: \n\nEngland : 113+96=209\nIndia : 101+82=182\n\nEngland extra overs = 209-182=27\n\nTest 2:\n\nEngland : 151+83=234\nIndia : 90+68=158\n\nEngland extra overs = 234-158=76\n\nTest 3:\n\nEngland : 119+75=194\nIndia : 112+75=187\n\nEngland extra overs = 194-187=7\n\n\nTest 4:\n\nEngland : 114+143=257\nIndia : 157\n\nEngland extra overs = 257-157=100\n\nTest 5:\n\nEngland : 70+18\\*=88\\*\n\nIndia : 51\\*\n\nEngland extra overs = 88-51=37\\*\n\nAcross 5 tests = 27+76+7+100+37\\*=247\\*\n\n\nSo across 5 tests, England bowlers have had to be in the field for a whooping 247 overs more than their Indian counterparts. That's close to 3 fulls days of play. \n\nAnd they blame the schedule and not the fact their Bazball approach leads to their bowlers spending more time on the field.",

He didn't play ODI cricket and only turned out a few times for Lancashire in the early season and/or when he felt like he needed a bit of competitive cricket. He was put on a lucrative central contract so he could rest between matches and series. He also had a great work ethic in keeping fit and in developing/honing new skills. Jasprit Bumrah could be the same if his workload is managed correctly, he too could still be playing at Test level when he's 40 so that's potentially another ten years from now. He's got to want to still be playing Test cricket then of course. Or they could grind him into the ground... But schedulers of Test cricket have got to look out for Test fast bowlers. The current Oval Test started yesterday four days after the Old Trafford match ended. One of those days, I presume Monday, would have been spent travelling so that's two days to rest and then prepare mentally and physically for the next match. How do the authorities expect fast bowlers to play every Test, or say four out of five, in a series when they are treated like cattle? So it makes sense to rest star players especially when they are a bit injury prone.",

Here's a bunch of data to back this up Here are the overs bowled by both teams so far this series Test 1: England : 113+96=209 India : 101+82=182 England extra overs = 209-182=27 Test 2: England : 151+83=234 India : 90+68=158 England extra overs = 234-158=76 Test 3: England : 119+75=194 India : 112+75=187 England extra overs = 194-187=7 Test 4: England : 114+143=257 India : 157 England extra overs = 257-157=100 Test 5: England : 70+18\\=88\\ India : 51\\ England extra overs = 88-51=37\\ Across 5 tests = 27+76+7+100+37\\=247\\ So across 5 tests, England bowlers have had to be in the field for a whooping 247 overs more than their Indian counterparts. That's close to 3 fulls days of play. And they blame the schedule and not the fact their Bazball approach leads to their bowlers spending more time on the field.",

You went from a solid, legbreak who can contribute a bit with the bat to a taller, pretty simple off break bowler who can't hold a bat. I'm sure him going back to county cricket helped develop him further but I really don't understand why either team didn't want to play some kind of genuine leg spin on those flat tracks.",
