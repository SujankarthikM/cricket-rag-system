They invite you to bat, You get a start, convert it into mega runs. \nCould've done the same in Leeds, but double collapse of lower order meant we left some runs out there.",

I would have hoped that their team buses would be driving next to each other down the M6, within hand shaking distance all the way to the Oval. They shook hands, that is that.

It’s embarrassing.” These are just a few examples of things England players said. Let’s not forget the laughing after every ball or clapping to mock Indian players. But since it’s England doing it, it all conveniently falls under the “spirit of cricket.” Stokes said it wouldn't make a difference if it’s 90 or 100, as long as it helps the team win. But then why was Stokes celebrating his own hundred earlier that day? Why shouldn’t Washi go for his maiden hundred? If he thinks milestones are selfish, then the first thing he should do is break the Lord's Honours Board.

The medical treatment was fair enough (particularly since Gill himself was having back massages on the field the day before) but being 90 seconds late is way too much. Additionally, if Zak Crawley keeps pulling away from the crease as Bumrah sets off on his run up, then calling him a coward is pretty justified imo. That second over would have been box office. Pretty disgraceful that England got away with it - at 6.53pm Crawley and Duckett should have been told they were going to face two overs irrespective of when the second over started. Something needs to be done, both sets of players just flat out ignoring umpire instructions all the time and defrauding spectators with slow over rates and slovenly play.",

      "title": "Ben Stokes: Unlike India, I’d have taken a draw over scoring a hundred",
      "content": "Ben Stokes: Unlike India, I’d have taken a draw over scoring a hundred Ben Stokes said he would have accepted a draw from the opposition rather than pursue personal milestones, as India did in a farcical end to the fourth Test. England offered to shake hands with 15 overs remaining on the final day at Old Trafford after Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, on 89 and 80 respectively, had saved India from defeat. The batsmen refused and faced five overs from Harry Brook and Joe Root, waiting for Jadeja to bring up his fifth Test hundred and Washington his first. Stokes did not want to risk any frontline bowlers with the fifth Test starting on Thursday at the Oval, and so turned to Brook, the only genuine unused option, who dropped as low as 35mph in serving up free hits for Jadeja. The England fielders barely acknowledged the landmarks, which Jadeja and Washington celebrated heartily, and suggested they would lack meaning. “As soon as it got to that point where the draw’s inevitable, I was never going to risk any of my frontline bowlers with the short turnaround that we have and the workload that we’ve got through this week and throughout the series as well,” Stokes said with his side still leading the series 2-1. “As soon as the 15 overs or last hour was there, it was always going to be a shake hands. “The only other person who’s actually got any bowling workload into them is Harry Brook. But I did have to tell him, ‘Please don’t do anything stupid. We can’t have you pulling a side or doing anything different.’ Naturally, you’re going to be fatigued, even if you don’t bowl. So, I was just like, ‘Get through this period.’ ” Stokes praised Jadeja and Washington’s innings, combining for a partnership of 203 in 55.2 overs to save the game, and Gautam Gambhir, the India head coach, suggested England would have done the same. “If someone is batting on 90 and the other one is batting on 85, don’t they deserve a hundred?” Gambhir said. “Would they have walked off if someone from England’s side would have been batting on 90 or 85, if someone had the opportunity to claim his first Test hundred? Wouldn’t you allow him to do it?” However, Stokes said the batsmen did not need three figures to make their efforts meaningful. “The situation that India found themselves in there with us opening the game open slightly, that partnership was massive,” the England captain said. “You hold your hands up. They played incredibly, incredibly well. I don’t think there would have been too much more satisfaction from walking off 100 not out, getting your team out of a tricky situation, than walking off at 80 or 90 not out. That’s what you’ve done for your team. “Ten more runs, or whatever it was, isn’t going to change the fact that you managed to get your team out of a very, very tricky situation and almost saved your team from a series defeat before the last game.”",
      "raw_selftext": "Ben Stokes said he would have accepted a draw from the opposition rather than pursue personal milestones, as India did in a farcical end to the fourth Test.\n\n\nEngland offered to shake hands with 15 overs remaining on the final day at Old Trafford after Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, on 89 and 80 respectively, had saved India from defeat. The batsmen refused and faced five overs from Harry Brook and Joe Root, waiting for Jadeja to bring up his fifth Test hundred and Washington his first.\n\n\nStokes did not want to risk any frontline bowlers with the fifth Test starting on Thursday at the Oval, and so turned to Brook, the only genuine unused option, who dropped as low as 35mph in serving up free hits for Jadeja. The England fielders barely acknowledged the landmarks, which Jadeja and Washington celebrated heartily, and suggested they would lack meaning.\n\n\n“As soon as it got to that point where the draw’s inevitable, I was never going to risk any of my frontline bowlers with the short turnaround that we have and the workload that we’ve got through this week and throughout the series as well,” Stokes said with his side still leading the series 2-1. “As soon as the 15 overs or last hour was there, it was always going to be a shake hands.\n\n\n“The only other person who’s actually got any bowling workload into them is Harry Brook. But I did have to tell him, ‘Please don’t do anything stupid. We can’t have you pulling a side or doing anything different.’ Naturally, you’re going to be fatigued, even if you don’t bowl. So, I was just like, ‘Get through this period.’ ”\n\n\nStokes praised Jadeja and Washington’s innings, combining for a partnership of 203 in 55.2 overs to save the game, and Gautam Gambhir, the India head coach, suggested England would have done the same.\n\n\n“If someone is batting on 90 and the other one is batting on 85, don’t they deserve a hundred?” Gambhir said. “Would they have walked off if someone from England’s side would have been batting on 90 or 85, if someone had the opportunity to claim his first Test hundred?

      "content": "Gavaskar: Everything cannot be done according to what the England team wants | If I were the captain, I’d have told Sundar &amp; Jadeja to keep batting &amp; play out the remaining overs, tiring out the fielders even more Old Trafford, Manchester, has not been the happiest of venues for the Indian cricket team in the past. They have never won a Test match there. So, when the Indian team arrived to play the fourth Test after narrowly losing the third at Lord’s, London, it was understandable that there was a sense of apprehension among Indian cricket lovers. The Manchester weather is often wet and cold, which doesn’t suit the Indian players. Luckily, though, there was hardly any interruption across the five days of the match. The remarkable fightback shown by the Indians after conceding a mammoth lead of 311 to England speaks volumes about the team’s determination and character, and now gives them a chance to level the series at The Oval in London. Towards the end of the Test, a few grumpy English players were unhappy that the batters at the crease, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, declined the offer to end the day’s play when England captain Ben Stokes proposed it at the start of the final hour. Instead, they opted to bat on and complete their hundreds. The England players felt that, since there was no chance of a result, the Indians should have accepted the offer to conclude proceedings. They seemed to forget that two teams are playing out there, and if one decides to continue, the other simply has to accept it. They made sarcastic remarks about the batters, who were in their 80s, getting to their centuries off the bowling of a batter. What they overlooked was the hard work and resilience the batters had shown against frontline bowlers for over four hours to reach the 80s. If they wanted a hundred for their efforts, England should have denied them with proper bowlers rather than whining about them getting there against Harry Brook. A Test century isn’t easy and doesn’t come every match, so the batters were fully entitled to bat on and reach their personal landmarks — which they eventually did. If I were the captain, I’d have told them to keep batting and play out the remaining overs, tiring out the fielders even more — especially after the shenanigans by the English players once their offer was declined. There’s only a three-day break before the next Test. If England didn’t want two more centuries recorded against them, they could have brought the quicks back on. The natural light was deteriorating, and the floodlights were on. Had Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse been given the ball, the umpires might have intervened and stopped play — so perhaps England missed a trick there. At one of the media conferences after the defeat in the second Test in Birmingham, some England players, trying to be funny, asked why India set them a target of over 600. They even went so far as to say that India were scared they’d chase anything above 450. The fact is, when they were on a high from scoring piles of runs on flat tracks and fast outfields in Pakistan, they even boasted ahead of the India tour last year that they could chase down 600. Well, talk is cheap, and when given the chance to put their money where their mouth is by chasing over 600 in Birmingham, they ended up losing by 336 runs. Yes, they didn’t even get to 300 while boasting of chasing over 600. Shubman Gill is a young skipper and a fine gentleman, so after the draw in Manchester, he didn’t ask why England batted on to score over 600 and take a lead of 311. Were they afraid that if the lead was just 250, India might score 500 and then bowl England out for less in the fourth innings? By batting on even after Stokes got his century, England perhaps didn’t leave their bowlers enough time to bowl India out and win the match and with it, the series. Everything cannot be done according to what the England team wants. This is yet another example of that old syndrome: when we do it, it’s right; when the opposition does the same, it’s wrong. Those days are long gone, and no one, least of all the Indian team, is going to simply accept it. These little irritants aside, it has been a terrific series, and the cricket from both sides has been riveting. The fifth and final Test at The Oval will hopefully deliver another thriller to round off what has been one of the finest Test series, a pleasure and privilege to watch",

      "content": "Jimmy Anderson: ‘My wife’s still angry England dropped me’ England’s leading Test wicket taker, Anderson, 42, played 188 Test matches for his country, claiming 704 wickets. Born in Burnley, he turned professional in 2000. He made his first appearance for England in 2002, the year after his Lancashire debut; he continues to play for the county. Anderson was awarded an OBE in 2015. He is married to Daniella Lloyd, a former model; they live with their two daughters in Greater Manchester. I normally wake up at 6.45am, and I won’t have slept particularly well — I rarely do. I’ll drop off the girls at their bus stop for school at 7.15, then come back for breakfast. Or, more often, I’ll go straight to Old Trafford, where I play for Lancashire, and have breakfast there. Weetabix or toast and coffee, and that’ll be me. Training starts at nine o’clock. Now I’m in my forties, I begin with a massage. I need to wake my hamstrings up. Then, from ten, it’s practice — nets, bowling — until around midday. It’s quite full-on, lots of training and travelling to games. But I like being busy. I enjoy the routine. I retired from international cricket last year, but not entirely willingly. I had a meeting with the captain, coach and director of the England cricket team in April, and they said they wanted to move in a different direction, and bring in some younger guys ahead of the Ashes. They kept me on in a team coach/mentor capacity, but I felt I still had an itch to scratch, and more cricket to play while my body was still able to. So I spoke to Lancashire and they got me on board. I’ll be honest, retirement was not in my head. I was still bowling as well as I ever had, and my body was in good shape. I was looking forward to the Ashes. All sport needs young people coming onto the scene, but you have to balance that with age and experience. It’s difficult. I’d been told that as long as I was good enough to warrant a place in the team, and fit enough, they’d keep picking me… but then they changed their mind. I did see their point. I wasn’t angry, though my wife was; probably still is. But then she’s always been my biggest supporter, my biggest help throughout my career. For me, age is just a number, and I don’t see 42 as being old at all. Yes, there are a few more grey hairs but I still perform to a high level. And while I do get injuries, I work hard at the gym to keep my body in a good place. Lunch is 12.30 or 1pm, and it’ll be pasta, chilli and rice; fuel for training. Then it’s back to the gym. I’ll leave between two and four. In the afternoons I like to have an hour to myself but that’s not always possible. I have the kids to pick up, then I take them to after-school activities, and I like to come home and cook dinner for everyone at around seven. When you’ve kids who are fairly fussy eaters, cooking can be a challenge but I like it. It’s therapeutic. My regulars include steak and sweet potato chips, pasta bakes, fajitas. I’ve been thinking about what to do when I eventually retire. I love the podcast I’m doing, Tailenders, with Greg James and the Maccabees guitarist Felix White. It’s great that Freddie Flintoff is now coaching England’s development squad, the Lions. He retired early, at 32, and went into TV but you can see that his interest in the game never stopped. He’s one of the best, most entertaining players England has ever produced, so it’s great for him to be able to use that level of knowledge. I’ve enjoyed dipping my toe in punditry and commentary, but I still have a lot of competitiveness in me that I need to quench. Coaching seems the inevitable way forward. I do still love cricket. Evenings, I like to watch sport on TV: football, darts, golf — any sport that’s on, really. It helps me relax. I’ll go to bed around 10.30, 11pm, but I won’t get to sleep much before midnight. I need to watch something to send me off, something like the US Office. And I don’t know if it’s an age thing, but I have to get up at least twice a night to go to the toilet. I can’t remember the last time I had seven hours straight. I just find it hard to switch off. An Evening with Jimmy Anderson tours the UK from September 4 Words of wisdom Best advice I was given There’s no such thing as a stupid question Advice I’d give Just be honest with yourself What I wish I’d known There’s no such thing as perfection",

How do you want to play this?\" If Jimmy wanted to remain eligible for selection the selectors could've said Jimmy was stepping back from international duties but if the team needed him or if conditions were suitable he said he would always help his country if called upon\".

The answer, of course, is stopping up an end and building pressure, something Jimmy was a bit of a dab hand at, particularly as his career went on. Obviously pressure and wickets would be nice, but if your pressure encourages the rash stroke that earns another bowler a wicket, then it amounts to the same thing really. You set 'em up, I'll knock 'em down kinda thing. So, I think while even Jimmy would concede - if he was being completely honest - that he had passed his wicket taking peak, he could still do a job for the team. Just obviously not enough of one for the management. Reading that, if anything, I'd say he was more annoyed than anything at the way it was handled. And, as an England fan, it did feel somewhat out of the blue. Shame he wasn't able to go out on his own terms like Broad.",

Ajaz Patel - Lead spinner but 2 matches with nothing of note and he is the match winner in the 3rd. Wow. Matt Henry - 46 All Out. Rohit Out. Will O'Rourke - 46 All Out. Excellent spell in the 2nd innings of 1st test with the 2nd new ball which caused the collapse. Mitch Santner - He's a white ball bowler. He sucks in Red ball. No! 2 fifers in a single test! Tim Southee - Peach to get Rohit out. Scored a 50! While India scored 46 A team performance. This is the best form of cricket. There's no one pivotal moment. Series like these tell a beautiful story.

A 127 run partnership then threatened to turn things around as Australia only got a 105 run lead. At 80/2, Australia would've been thinking of scoring quickly to set up the chase which showed itself in Smith's poor shot leading to losing 4 wickets for 11 runs, puting India right back if not ahead in the game. From 91/6 two 50+ run partnerships (including one for the 10th wicket) set up a 340 off 92 overs chase. India started off great giving Australia no chances before Cummins striked twice. The 4th wicket partnership were dead set on getting India safely to the end before a late collapse of 34/7, with the old ball which has been so torrid for bowlers this test, left Australia with an incredible win. What a boxing day test it has been.",

All that being said, kudos to NZ, important to give them the credit they deserve. it's very easy to make this all about how bad India were and ignore how exceptional NZ have been particularly with the ball",

I feel you have changed your game considerably towards the end of your career to fit into the modern t20 game better, I feel your keen insights into t20 would certainly help with identifying and training younger t20 players. Also you have vast experience at the domestic level and are aware of many of the lesser known players who play in domestic cricket all across India. Also another quick question, if a team wanted to hire you as an injury replacement in the IPL in the next season is it possible? (as per the IPL rules/ would you consider it). Would love to see you at CSK 😁",

My friends reached out to see how to watch it and if we could set up a watch party for the rest of the US matches. But guess what, noone is going to pay $7 just to buy Willow for 2 matches. Not to mention, couldn't watch the game with them to explain it because they are at 10:30am on weekdays. I don't understand how the ICC could screw this up so badly. They were literally handed the dream opportunity to grow the game, but instead throw it all way to pander to the BCCI and Indian market.

But guess what, noone is going to pay $7 just to buy Willow for 2 matches. \n\nNot to mention, couldn't watch the game with them to explain it because they are at 10:30am on weekdays.\n\nI don't understand how the ICC could screw this up so badly. They were literally handed the dream opportunity to grow the game, but instead throw it all way to pander to the BCCI and Indian market. I am so tired of the ICCs corruption, and cricket will continue to die until something changes.",

I do agree with your other points that to grow it beyond subcontinental immigrants, it has to aired on ESPN &amp; explainers should be made. I think the best thing would be Olympics. Before that, ICC needs to start showing cricket like Major League Cricket &amp; IPL, few international games on ESPN to capture some amount of interested audience. Cricket doesn't need to the No. 1 sport in US. Even if they can capture 10-15 M audience, that's big enough for natural expansion. South Asian Americans make up around 6.5 M (wiki data).

Combined with the early 2021 T20 WC exit, Asia Cup humiliation, this is a true nadir for a team if I ever saw one. How many clear factors behind the debacle can an average fan list? Let's see: A. Clown selection panel - How many times have they picked wrong players for wrong formats? How many in form/X factor players have they left out for 'safe choices'? In all formats too. Shaw, Iyer, Samson, Sarfaraz, Ruturaj, Bishnoi, Umran...list goes on. B. Stone Age tactics - India are laughably inept in this department. Three anchors in PP, no effort to develop late order hitters, bad player-role matchups, no express pace, timid XI selections...you name it, they have done it. C. Atrocious injury management - Does one need to even elaborate? How many recoveries has NCA fucked up? Bumrah, Bhuvi, Jadeja, Hardik come to mind just off the top of my head. Three of them are generational talents FFS. What a shitshow! Given the resources, player pool and money Indian cricket has, the platform IPL provides, they have no excuse for such systemic, repeated failures and resulting debacles.

You can't enforce social distancing with that big crowd. Plus I see people commenting about mask. Staying at home is the best option. I put my mask religiously when I go out but tell you the truth, it's extremely uncomfortable and I start feeling suffocation after an hour or so. So I wouldn't pass on judgement to people who sit in afternoon in that heat watching test match because I know even I would make a mistake and remove it. T20 is shorter so you see more people wearing it",

      "content": "How do you feel about BYJUs Logo on the Indian Cricket team's T-shirt? They filed a $2.75M defamation case over me. Hi Yesterday, ICC announced BYJU'S as global partner until 2023 Are you guys ok with BYJUs written all over, especially on the Indian Cricket team's T-Shirt? I am not. BYJUs recently bought a startup called WhiteHatJr for $300M. This startup was really suspicious. Their false advertisements, sales pitch, curriculum. Everything seemed to have issues in it. In Sept 2020, When I looked deeper I found many issues. I decided to write about it on Quora and Reddit. Soon my accounts were suspended. So I moved to YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn and soon those accounts were also taken down. In total 17 videos, 2 YT channels, 2 Twitter handles permanently suspended, 3 articles from LinkedIn, the LinkedIn account itself was suspended twice, and these are just my accounts. 100s of other's accounts were taken down by BYJUs and WhiteHatJr ORM team. WhiteHatJr and Byjus tried their best to take down all my content from the internet and when I kept on making new accounts, they filed a $2.75M defamation lawsuit over me. Please google search \"Pradeep Poonia WhiteHat Jr\" to know more about the case, you will find a lot of news articles, videos, and posts regarding the same. The case is still in Delhi High Court, the next hearing is on 9th April. They have a lot of money and a bunch of lawyers to drag this case for years while I become penniless. For eg in the first hearing, they got India's ex-Attorney General of India, Mukul Rohtagi to represent them. BYJUs is notorious for taking down dissent from the Internet, manipulating Quora and google play reviews, inhumane work culture in their offices, pushing poor parents into loan traps, creating issues for parents in refunds, the list goes on and on. Earlier Sahara India used to sponsor BCCI, which turned out to be a big fraud. Then I think KingFisher was also for some time sponsoring some cricket teams in IPL. And now this BYJUs. Now I know this post is not directly related to cricket, but in a way it is. When we watch cricket we generate value. Our viewership is valuable. We help brands make money. Shouldn't we have a little say in who gets to sponsor ICC or BCCI? It would be much more fun to watch cricket if even the brands printed on cricketers T-shirts are some good ethical brands we trust and like, it would be more fun to support teams that way. Why is the that it's mostly a scam which gets to get printed on T-shirts? PS: I did a very polite comment under Anurag Dahiya's (Chief Commercial Officer of international cricket council) LinkedIn post saying we don't like seeing Byjus everywhere while watching cricket. And guess what, just like Byjus, he also deleted my comment. EDIT: I have started a change. org petiton. Link in the comments. Please do sign it, together we can really make a difference. Thank you.

There was this crack on the pitch around the short- of-length spot from where the ball would just take off. Cummins has the skill to make the ball rear up from there and make it follow you. In case I took my hand up to defend it, there was a risk that I would glove the ball. Considering the match situation and how we couldn’t afford to lose wickets, I decided to let the ball hit my body,” he says.  \n\n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/gabba-win-no-pain-no-gain-cheteshwar-pujara-interview-pujara-family-interview-the-fiercest-battle-7155228/](https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/gabba-win-no-pain-no-gain-cheteshwar-pujara-interview-pujara-family-interview-the-fiercest-battle-7155228/)",

It ended up being far more intense and hilarious than I expected so popped it up on soc med, thought it was funnier to imply it was out of the blue (honestly quite drunk and sleep deprived), hence why I blacked out the name, honestly didnt even think about the culture of the cricket subreddit or bringing the community into disrepute. Genuinely was just a laugh. But I'd like to genuinely apologize. I didnt think it through properly and it's not something I'd do again.\n\n&gt;Tldr: I'm sorry!! I think its just in the nature to stretch the truth online for comedic effect but I obviously went too far here. Big cricket fan, big fan of the subreddit, and hope you guys can forgive me.\n\nI think it is only fair that she should apologise and come clean on Twitter where she made the accusation and received thousands of RTs and likes by maligning the sub and the users here for her own personal gains. And also that she should be banned from this sub for this outright disgusting behaviour.\n\nPS: I made this post since the original post received a lot of attention but the subsequent revelations and her apology here didn't get proper attention.",
